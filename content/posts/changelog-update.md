# Project Update: First Release

I'm excited to announce the first release of our Hugo-powered website! This post documents the changes and improvements we've made to get the site up and running.

## Version 0.1.0 (April 6, 2025)

### What's New

- **Initial Project Setup**: We've set up a new Hugo site as the foundation for our blog
- **Terminal Theme**: We've integrated the beautiful, retro-inspired Terminal theme
- **Sample Content**: Created the basic content structure with an initial post
- **GitHub Repository**: The project is now hosted at [github.com/gahoccode/testing-hugo-12](https://github.com/gahoccode/testing-hugo-12)
- **GitHub Pages**: The site is deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages

### Technical Changes

- Replaced `paginate = 5` with the new `[pagination]` section and `pagerSize = 5` parameter in hugo.toml
- Modified theme configuration in hugo.toml to use the Terminal theme

### Bug Fixes

- Resolved Hugo build error: "site config key paginate was deprecated in Hugo v0.128.0"
- Fixed content structure to match Terminal theme requirements by adding `content/posts` directory

### Deployment Details

- The main branch contains all source code
- The gh-pages branch contains the built static site ready for serving

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve the site and add more content. We're planning to enhance the theme customization, add more interactive features, and of course, publish more interesting articles!
